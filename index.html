        <p>
            Koenigsegg is a sweedish hypercar manufacturer and they have recently developed one of the most powerful, but family-friendly hypercar
            yet, the <em>Koenigsegg Gemera</em>. The Gemera is a mid-engine<br> vehicle that sports up to 1667 horsepower while at the same time 
            being powered by a 3 piston engine. The engine uses their exclusive FreeValve technology to get these monstrous perofermance numbers,<br> 
            while at the same time being able to comfortably seat four people. The car also contains a revolutionary hybrid driving system that allows
            for conservation of gasoline by powering the engine using electricity<br> from the car’s battery where applicable. 
            The car has an incredibly quick acceleration time of 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 1.9 seconds and can reach a top speed of 249 mph. 
            In electric mode this speed decreases<br> to 186 mph. The car only has 2 doors, but they are extremely large as seen in the picture and 
            the open upwards showcasing that this isn’t just some ordinary car. The Gemera doesn’t have a fixed price yet,<br> but we will be able to 
            see it in action next year with a starting price of at least $1 million.

        <p>
            <em> Rocket League </em> is a video game developed by Pysonix released to PC and Playstation 4 owners  in 2014. 
            The game has taken off in popularity recently with Epic Games, developer of the incredibly<br> popular shooting game 
            Fortnite, gaining acquisition of Pysonix. The game revolves around playing soccer against opponents with cars that 
            you control in a game of soccer. You can drive with the car,<br> flip with it, and even fly with it using each car’s rocket 
            boost with the main goal of getting the ball in your opponents goals. With the acquisition from Epic Games, the game 
            recently became free to play,<br> as you had to purchase it before, so there is quite a lot of popularity with the game now 
            as many new players are trying it. You can choose what car you want to play with and customize almost every little detail <br>
            down to what your car engine sounds look to what the goal explosion animation looks like when you score. Rocket League is 
            a great game to play with friends and there are other fun, extra modes you can play<br> like hockey and basketball. What’s great 
            about this game as well is that it’s cross platform so you can play with any of your friends regardless of 
            what device they choose to play from.
