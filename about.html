            Hello! My name is Abi Venkat and I am a student at Michigan State University studying Computer Science. 
            I'm in my final year as a senior<br> and expecting to graduate this fall, December 2020.
            Iâ€™m looking forward to my future, hoping to enter the field of data science or business administration. 
        </p>
        <p>Some of the things I like to do in do in my free time are play</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Video games</li>
            <li>Tennis</li>
            <li>Piano</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I've been playing tennis since I was in middle school and I've enjoyed playing it recreationally, but I have played many years competetively as well.
            <br>I played on my high school's varsity team for three years and also played in local clubs and tournaments. I've played piano for almost
            as long if not longer<br> and although I don't compete anymore, in high school I did participate in competetions. I don't play the violin anymore
            , but I did play it for a good seven years. I should probably get back into that!
